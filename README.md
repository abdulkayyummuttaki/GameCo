# Video Game Popularity Data Project




## 01 Objectives

An analyst for a new video game company, GameCo, which wants to
use data to inform the development of new games. As such, Data Analyst has been
asked to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game data set to foster a
better understanding of how GameCo’s new games might fare in the market.



## 02 Key Questions from stakeholders

**GameCo executives** are open to hearing any insights pulled from the data but
are specifically interested in the following questions:

● Are certain types of games more popular than others?

● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?

● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?

● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?


Stakeholders: GameCo Executive


## 03 Target Audience

The audience for this project is the hypothetical company GameCo, specifically its
executives who’ve asked you to gather insights. For a further sense of the “who,”
please refer to the hypothetical stakeholder quotes below.

● **Vice President of Marketing**:​ “We’re always eager to know which genres of
games are performing the best, so we can allocate our marketing budget
efficiently.”
    
● **Chief Financial Officer**:​ “It’s imperative that we keep tabs on competitors and
what share of the market they’re gaining or losing. Part of how we
communicate our success to investors by showing how we’re able to grow
our business in an area where a competitor’s business is shrinking.”
    
● **Senior Vice President of Sales**:​ “We must understand swings in
the market. If one market becomes more dominant over time in terms of
sales, we’ll want to know so we can make sure we have a sufficient number of
sales reps serving that market.”
    

## 04 Final Analysis Criteria
    ● Must include summary stats on several variables.
    ● Must include three different types of visualizations.
    ● Visualizations must be clearly labelled.
    ● Final project needs to be professional 
    

## 05 Data Set

We’ll use a data set covering historical video game sales (for games that sold 
more than 100,000 copies) spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing
studios. This data was drawn from the website VGChartz​.

Important points regarding the data set:
● It tracks the total number of units of games sold (not financial figures) from
1980 to 2016.
● The numbers represent units sold in millions. When you see the number “1.2,”
for instance, this represents a total of 1.2 million units sold.


## 06 Skills/Tools/Procedures
    • Excel
    
    • Grouping Data
    
    • Summarising the data
    
    • Descriptive Analysis
    
    • Visualising results in Excel
    
    • Presenting results

## 06 Folder Structure

      
**02 Data**
     This folder will contain any data sets used in the project. Within this folder have two additional subfolders: “Original Data” for storing the raw data sets, and “Prepared Data”, for storing any manipulated data sets.

**05 Sent to client**
This folder will contain all the final deliverables you’ve sent to the client. These should be the latest versions of any results you’ve produced and should be kept up to date.

## 07 Approach to the problem

### Understanding the data
        • Understanding the data and classifying the data set as Quantitative or Qualitative.

### Data cleaning
        • Identifying the source of data, data bias and gaps.
        • Identify dirty data and analytics practice methods of cleaning data

### Analytics
        • Experiment with the fundamentals of descriptive analysis by exploratory data analysis (EDA).
        • Identify the Symmetrical and Skewed Distribution.

### Storytelling
        • Develop data visualisations for stakeholders.
        • Develop a narrative about data insights for stakeholders.



## 08 Final presentation to stakeholders

Using pivot tables and visualisation tools, some of the insights from the data.




## 09 Conclusion

• GameCo administrative assumed sales across regions are consistent over the year,
and the distribution of marketing resources equally would generate more revenue. 
But the sales timeline graph across regions has different profits.

• Marketing resource distribution is prioritised depending on the publication, 
genre and platform, the games are played in each region. 

• Shipping dates could be the possibility for the lower sale values in other
regions. Online access/streaming of the games could generate faster revenue.

• Shipping dates could be the possibility for the lower sale values in other
regions. Online access/streaming of the games could generate faster revenue.
